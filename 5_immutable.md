# 5. Immutable

The container image contains the OS, libraries, configurations, files and application code. Once a container image is built it shouldnâ€™t be changed, especially not between different staging environments like dev, qa and production. State should be extracted and changes to the container should be applied by rebuilding the container.

**Best practices on being immutable:**
* Have a [dev / prod parity](http://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity) with the container image
* Extract runtime state in volumes
* Create a final file layout on build
* And don't go into the container and change configuration with the risk of creating a [SnowflakeServer](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html)
