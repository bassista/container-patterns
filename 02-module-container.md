# Module container

## Defintion

The term "module container" builds upon the term "application container" coined by Docker. An application container focuses on running a single process inside a container in contrast to multiple processes per container. Different processes are spread out to different containers. A module container focuses on the aspect on being a good building block. In addition it suggests an even smaller granularity. And thinks of building an application of multiple containers.
